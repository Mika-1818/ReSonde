### ReSonde

Worlds lightest high altitude Radiosonde. At least it's supposed to be. Not tested. YET!


The code will rapidly change and isn't complete as of now. It is very experimental, but feel free to give it a try. The Hardware will be published soon.

## You will find a guide on how to flash the firmware to the receiver (ttgo V2) in the wiki of this repository!
